How can I track tool dependencies for a module?
If you:

want to use a go-based tool (e.g. stringer) while working on a module, and
want to ensure that everyone is using the same version of that tool while tracking the tool's version in your module's go.mod file
then one currently recommended approach is to add a tools.go file to your module that includes import statements for the tools of interest (such as import _ "golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer"), along with a //go:build tools build constraint. The import statements allow the go command to precisely record the version information for your tools in your module's go.mod, while the //go:build tools build constraint prevents your normal builds from actually importing your tools.

For a concrete example of how to do this, please see this "Go Modules by Example" walkthrough.

A discussion of the approach along with an earlier concrete example of how to do this is in this comment in #25922.

The brief rationale (also from #25922):

I think the tools.go file is, in fact, the best practice for tool dependencies, certainly for Go 1.11.

I like it because it does not introduce new mechanisms.

It simply reuses existing ones.
