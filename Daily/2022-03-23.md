### vscode memo
paste images
- install [vscode-paste-image](https://github.com/mushanshitiancai/vscode-paste-image)

    For pasting images from clipboard you can install and use vscode-paste-image. Thanks to VSCode Marketplace and the author of vscode-paste-image 💙.

    Example of settings.json for embedding images using `![[2020-08-12-20-11-46.png]]` format and saving them in Attachments folder automatically:

    ```json
    {
    "pasteImage.insertPattern": "![[${imageFileName}]]",
    "pasteImage.path": "${projectRoot}/Attachments"
    }
    ```

    After configuring vscode-paste-image extension, just copy some image and execute Paste image from the command palette and you are good to go 👍. You can create a shortcut for this command as well!

However, it could pastes, but configure failed.

Reason: another extension called hexo-utils using same command, with same effect as pasting image.
But that extension could not accept this config.
So, uninstall it, done.
